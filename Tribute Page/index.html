<p>

    After returning to India in 1949, Dr. Kurien was assigned to the Government Creamery in Anand, Gujarat, under a bond to serve the government for a few years. Uninterested in the government job, he was soon approached by Tribhuvandas Patel, the founder of the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union, to help set up a dairy cooperative in Anand. Kurien accepted the challenge and joined the cooperative, which would later become known as AMUL (Anand Milk Union Limited).

This initiative aimed to create a nationwide milk grid, connecting rural producers with urban markets, thus eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices for farmers.
